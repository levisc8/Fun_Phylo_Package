## FunPhylo 
This is a package to house the data and functions necessary to run the Shiny Phylo Fun web app. Most of the code has been written with a specific data set and anaylsis in mind, and so is not yet generalized to work with other data sets. However, the goal is to eventually develop the means to run this app for many other data sets and so this will evolve simultaneously
